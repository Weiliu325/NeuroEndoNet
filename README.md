# Mathematical Modeling of the Interaction Between Endocrine Systems and EEG Signals

This repository hosts the implementation and documentation of a novel mathematical and computational framework for modeling the complex interaction between endocrine regulatory systems and EEG signals. By integrating advanced network dynamics and adaptive strategies, the model bridges physiological modeling with real-world clinical application.

## üß† Project Overview

The intricate interplay between the **endocrine system** and **EEG signals** plays a critical role in regulating physiological and neurological health. Traditional models often struggle to reflect the nonlinear, feedback-driven, and cross-system interactions characteristic of these systems.

To address these limitations, this project introduces:

- **Hormone Interaction Dynamics Network (HIDN)**:  
  A graph-based neural architecture that captures spatial-temporal dependencies among endocrine glands, hormonal fluctuations, and EEG signals.

- **Adaptive Hormonal Regulation Strategy (AHRS)**:  
  A dynamic strategy to optimize therapeutic interventions in real-time, accounting for patient-specific parameters and external perturbations.
